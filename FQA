Why does your Dyno look different?

Because we have Dyno premium here
Premium benefits include higher speed and performance, better uptimes, 
fewer/quicker restarts for updates, unlimited song/play length, volume control, 
Cleverbot, and some other things we can't add to the public dyno for performance or cost purposes. 
Some other features to come are twitter integration, additional automod options, 
action log improvements, and anything else we can think to add that may give additional value to users and server owners.
Let's also not forget the features that we're working on for all of Dyno as well, they will be rolled out as they come available and tested thoroughly to ensure stability.
Premium is $5/month.
